2. Explanations:
- A server is a computer that provides resources or services to clients over a network.
- The domain name (foobar.com) maps a human-readable name to the server's IP address.
- The www in www.foobar.com is an A record in DNS, pointing to 8.8.8.8.
- The web server (Nginx) handles HTTP requests and serves static content or forwards requests to the application server.
- The application server runs the website's code and processes dynamic requests.
- The database (MySQL) stores and manages the website's data.
- The server communicates with the user's computer using the HTTP/HTTPS protocol.

3. Issues:
- Single Point of Failure (SPOF): if the server fails, the website is down.
- Downtime during maintenance: updating or restarting services causes downtime.
- Cannot scale: one server cannot handle high traffic.
